Final Project for Data Mining

This project gathers traffic accident and parking violation data to produce a report for drivers who park near Columbia University.

The markdown file automatically pulls information from NYC Open Data (Parking Violations Issued 2014-2020 and Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes) and produces a map of accident locations and histograms of parking ticket counts for two streets that run exclusively through the area of interest (Claremont Ave and Morningside Dr). At the bottom of the file, the function parkHelp(hour[0-23], day[0-6]) returns an accident and ticket risk report for a given day and hour. The report references the colored clusters from the generated map.
